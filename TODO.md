# Optimization / Cleanup
- [ ] use computed() less, wherever possible
- [ ] move user / session storage to an offline JSON config file
  - [ ] also consider using firebase? mostly because of the storage limit on mobile
- [ ] return a null character from the store to handle offline users
- [ ] organize components into subfolders (overlays, chat views, etc.)
- [ ] limit the size of the message list to prevent hardcore memory leaks
- [ ] move socket logic to application side out of the view
- [x] find a way to solve the bottleneck rendering 400~500 character elements at once
- [x] holy memory usage batman
- [x] ~~find a better way to organize chat tabs declaratively~~ just using events and not being stupid with focusing works
- [x] make a file for reference events that pass through the program
- [x] move to electron

# Bugs
- [ ] fix the goddamn overlays
- [x] check if the socket connection already exists before authenticating
- [x] characters are not removed from active channels when they go offline
- [x] bookmarks seem a little wonky. look into that
