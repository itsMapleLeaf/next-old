# F-Chat Next
> An alternative F-Chat client with modern, intuitive, and responsive design in mind.

[Live Demo](http://kingdaro.net/fchat)

## Note: Incomplete!
This client is in no way close to finished, but is in a usable state, so feel free to test for bugs and such.

To see what has yet to be added, check out the [TODO.md](https://github.com/Kingdaro/fchat/blob/master/docs/TODO.md) file for a list.

If you do happen to find a bug, or if you have any suggestions, comments or concerns, [submit an issue for it](https://github.com/Kingdaro/fchat/issues), or note me at [Alexander Grapevine](https://www.f-list.net/c/alexander%20grapevine/) on F-List.
